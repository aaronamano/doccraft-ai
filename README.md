# About
Turn documentation into markdown files as context for coding agents to use.

## What it does
Users input a URL (e.g. a youtube video covering best practices or regular text documentation), which generates a markdown file where users can download it.

## Setup
```bash
git clone https://github.com/aaronamano/doccraft-ai
conda create -n doccraft-ai -y python=3.14
conda activate doccraft-ai
pip install -r requirements.txt
python main.py
```

## Demo
**NOTE:** this video has been trimmed and edited. it doesn't show the response accurately in real time from inputting a url to downloading the markdown file
